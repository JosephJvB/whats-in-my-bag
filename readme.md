# Basically a recursive `cat | grep`

### todos: 
- dont load all files contents into memory, use readline: https://stackabuse.com/reading-a-file-line-by-line-in-node-js/
- allow config for ignored file patterns
- get file line number for matches
- handle recursive file depth: count it.. limit it in config.. something..
